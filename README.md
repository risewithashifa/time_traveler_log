# Time Traveler's Log

This is a beginner-friendly Python mini project built as part of my learning journey.

 **What it does:**
- Lets you input a year to travel to (past, present, or future)
- Takes a note for each year visited
- Prints a travel log at the end with all your notes

 Created using only basic Python concepts like:
- Variables, loops, if-else
- Dictionaries
- User input

 Idea & Motivation:
I built this as my first mini project to apply my Python basics.  
More features will be added soon!
